## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A gentle light-sky blue (#87CEEB) evokes feelings of commitment and ceremony.
- Background color: A muted, light gray (#F0F0F0) that allows the blue elements to stand out without being overpowering, maintaining a focus on user-uploaded imagery.
- Accent color: A complementary light, muted violet (#D8BFD8), providing subtle highlights to guide user attention.
- Body and headline font: 'Alegreya', a humanist serif font lending an elegant, intellectual, contemporary feel.
- Right-to-left (RTL) layout to support Hebrew text and UI components, optimizing the app for Hebrew speakers.
- Use simple and elegant icons. In particular, icons related to food must follow kosher standards and be clear about the absence of shellfish or pork.
- Use subtle, respectful animations during user flows (for example, approving a reservation). Do not use audio.
